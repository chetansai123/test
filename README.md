First fork the project and install the npm dependencies.I haven't added .env file which contain MONGO_DB_URI and PORT. Connect to mongoDb  connection through mongoDb Driver connection with username and passwork and give portname for Backend to run on a server specified by port.

Then run npm i in frontend subfolder then do the same in backend subfolder then in root folder run npm i and run npm run dev which starts both backend and frontend server's immediately through single command.
